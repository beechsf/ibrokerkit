	<p>Here you can configure the i-services associated with your XRI. Currently we offer
	the following four i-services:
	<ul>
	<li>Authentication (Single Sign On)</li>
	<li>Contact Page</li>
	<li>Forwarding</li>
	<li>Locator</li>
	</ul>
	</p>
	<p>Note that normally you should not need to add or delete i-services manually. Use
	the wizard in the XRI list instead and then adjust the i-services to your need using
	this configuration panel.</p>
