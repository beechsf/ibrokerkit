These files are Velocity templates used by the Authentication i-service to render its pages.
For each file, a short description is provided, as well as a list of variables that are
set when the template is loaded:

TEMPLATE FILES
==============

authentication-base.vm:
-----------------------

This is the "base" template used by all other templates. It should contain elements that you
want to appear on all "sub-" templates, e.g. your logo, basic design, links to your terms of
services, etc.

What it must contain at a minimum:
- A <div wicket:id="velocity"></div> element. This is where the "sub-" templates will be
inserted.

What variables are set:
- All variables from your application.properties file.
- The $encoder utility object.

authentication-head.vm:
-----------------------

This template is used to render the <head> section of all other templates. It can contain
<title>, <link>, etc.

What it must contain at a minimum:
(nothing)

What variables are set:
- All variables from your application.properties file.
- The $encoder utility object.

authentication-index.vm:
------------------------

This template is used when a user accesses your i-service without any path 
(e.g. http://authn.youribroker.com/). You should use this to explain the service and 
possibly link to further information.

What it must contain at a minimum:
(nothing)

What variables are set:
- All variables from your application.properties file.
- The $encoder utility object.

authentication-error.vm:

This template is used when a problem occurs in the i-service web application. There are
different kinds of errors. You should use this to explain to the user what has happened.

What it must contain at a minimum:
(nothing)

What variables are set:
- All variables from your application.properties file.
- The $encoder utility object.
- One of the following: $exexpired, $exinternal, $exexception
-- $exexpired means that the session with the user has expired
-- $exinternal means that an internal error in the web framework has occurred
-- $exexception means that an exception was raised while running the web application. In
   this case, additional variables are set:
   -- $exclass the Java class of the exception
   -- $extime the timestamp of the exception
   -- $expath the URI path at which the exception was raised
   -- $exmessage the human readable message associated with the exception
   -- $extrace the detailed stack trace of the exception

authentication-authentication.vm:

This template is used to render the Authentication page for an i-name, with a form for users 
to fill out and submit.

What it must contain at a minimum:
- A <div wicket:id="feedbackPanel"></div> element. This is where feedback to the user will 
  be inserted, e.g. if they enter a wrong password.
- A <form wicket:id="authenticationForm"></form> element. This is the actual Authentication
  form, where users can type their password. This element in turn must contain the following
  sub-element:
-- <input wicket:id="pass"> for the user's password.

What variables are set:
- All variables from your application.properties file.
- The $encoder utility object.

(nothing)

What variables are set:
