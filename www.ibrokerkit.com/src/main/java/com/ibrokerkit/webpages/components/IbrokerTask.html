	<h2>Description</h2>

	<p>This is a standalone Java application that is meant to be run in the background from 
	time to time, for example once a day. It performs the following maintenance tasks:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>It polls all incoming events from the i-brokerâ€™s GRS queue using EPP. Examples of such events are approved or rejected i-name transfer requests. ibrokerTask appropriately handles these events.</li>
	<li>It checks all registered i-names for their expiration date and sends e-mails reminding their owners to renew them.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h2>Packaging</h2>
	
	<p>ibrokerTask is packaged as an executable .JAR file.</p>
