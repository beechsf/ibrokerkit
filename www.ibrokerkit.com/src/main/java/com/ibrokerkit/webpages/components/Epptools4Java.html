	<h2>Description</h2>

	<p>This component builds directly on NeuStarâ€™s EPP toolkit. It provides the following
	functionality on top of the toolkit:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>Maintaining a connection pool and automatic re-opening of connections.</li>
	<li>Convenience methods to facilitate EPP operations such as registrations, updates, transfers, renewals, etc.</li>
	<li>Compatibility methods for converting between OpenXRI data structures and EPP toolkit data structures, e.g. for service endpoints, Refs, etc.</li>
	<li>Storage of every single EPP transaction. This makes the i-broker compliant with section 3.10.2.1 of the I-Broker Agreement of the Global Service Specification at <a href="http://gss.xdi.org/">http://gss.xdi.org/</a>.</li>
	</ul>
